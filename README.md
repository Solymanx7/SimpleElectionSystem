# SimpleElectionSystem

Mobile app that is running totally through voice commands.  
The main purpose is to make people elect the candidates they want for the presidential election.  
There are 2 candidates: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton.  
How to use it?  
1- say “vote” or “start”  
2- answer the asked questions  
3- for the national ID answer : “111” or “123” or “721” , note that once you voted u can’t use it again  
4- continue the process normally  
You still can use the basic commands like call number or call friend.  
I’m using firebase as DB and google API for voice recognition and speech synthesis
